MongoDB
=======

*MongoDB in 45 minutes* is our Database Systems Laboratory project.

Our goal is to introduce the pros and cons of an alternative way of data storing - NoSQL, document database.
>If you got tired of traditional SQL systems, you could not find a better place to brush up your knowledge. We will change your point of view and ensure you that working with databases can be a pleasure. 
>If you are new to database systems - it is good for you as well, thanks to our guidance you will never use any database system other than MongoDB! 

Take a while to clone, read & run, after 45 minutes you will be running your own web service based on Node.js and MongoDB.
Firstly we will satisfy you with a bit of theory and then we will show you how to configure and run the system just in a few steps.

Experience the power and simplicity of MongoDB!

Introduction
----

*TO DO*:
* MnogoDB intro
* NoSql
* document-oriented storage
* repliacation, scalability, availibility
* auto-sharding
* querying,
* map-reduce
* etc.

SQL vs. NoSQL
---

*TO DO*:
* SQL
* NoSQL
* diff
* why NoSQL is still better

Where to NoSQL
----

*TO DO*:
* simple examples: student with a bag and books, a pencilcase (with a rubber and a pencil) and etc. inside and another one with a notebook bag only - no database schema etc., and very different models of one subject.
* easy general SELECT with no detailed conditions
* etc.

Where not to NoSQL
---

*TO DO*:
* when SELECTing very specified queries or SELECTs with joins
* model architecture that must be mapped on tables
* anything else?

Let's code
----

Now the most interesting part of our tutorial. 
We will show you how to configure your environment, how to run your MongoDB database and how to store and query some data. 
In the end of our tour you will run the web service to illustrate examples from the introduction part.

OK, let's do it!

MongoDB configuration
----

*TO DO*
* system requirements
* download 
* install
* database connect

Commandline integration
----

*TO DO*
* database connect
* some inserts
* some queries

Webservice configuration
----

*TO DO*
* download Node.js and other libs
* install
* run
* like http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/

Implementation - example no. 1
----
*TO DO*
* the first moment to complement our code - i.e. student wth a notebook bag
* result


Implementation - example no. 2
----
*TO DO*
* another example
* result

Implementation - final example
----
*TO DO*
* Final result
* Encouregment to further development

Summary
----
*TO DO*
* just a simple summary

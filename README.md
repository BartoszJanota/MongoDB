MongoDB
=======

*MongoDB in 45 minutes* is our Database Systems Laboratory project.

Our goal is to introduce the pros and cons of an alternative way of data storing - NoSQL, document database.
>If you got tired of traditional SQL systems, you could not find a better place to brush up your knowledge. We will change your point of view and ensure you that working with databases can be a pleasure. 
>If you are new to database systems - it is good for you as well, thanks to our guidance you will never use any database system other than MongoDB! 

Take a while to clone, read & run, after 45 minutes you will be running your own web service based on Node.js and MongoDB.
Experience the power and simplicity of MongoDB!
